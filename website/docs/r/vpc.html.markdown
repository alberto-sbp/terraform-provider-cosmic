## Import (EXPERIMENTAL)

VPCs can be imported; use `<VPC ID>` as the import ID. For
example:

```shell
terraform import cosmic_vpc.default 84b23264-917a-4712-b8bf-cd7604db43b0
```

When importing into a project you need to prefix the import ID with the project name:

```shell
terraform import cosmic_vpc.default my-project/84b23264-917a-4712-b8bf-cd7604db43b0
```
